# kiki
 A generic system for evaluating and classifying data into enumerators (IEnummerable's) where their classification terms and conditions can be dynamically scripted.

I initially designed it for academic purposes, but it can be used for various purposes.
### Why 'kiki' ?
I called the project 'kiki' because it's the name of a good friend I have - practically the only human being with whom I can express what I really feel when it comes to emotions, and also because I developed this project while trying to distract myself so as not to feel missing her while she couldn't be around.
### The story behind Kiki
 Working at Qbinary - as one of the **SAPE (School Process Automation System)** developers, we needed something capable of evaluating students based on the **Complex** Angolan **Assessment system** and presenting the results (like knowing if a student passes or fails, if var to appeal or approve with overdue chairs), like any good team, we developed an algorithm capable of doing what we needed, but it was not complete and had some flaws and also whenever it was necessary to make a change to the Assessment system, we had to **recompile the System**; that's why I decided to challenge my brain and develop something that was more **dynamic**, **fast**, **effective**, solving the problems mentioned above.
### Important :warning:
Within this project is also [Lizzie](https://github.com/polterguy/lizzie "Lizzie") - is a dynamic scripting language for .Net based upon a design pattern called "Symbolic Delegates". This allows you to execute dynamically created scripts, that does neither compile nor are interpreted, but instead "compiles" directly down to managed CLR delegates. ...it was modified by me to achieve my purposes
